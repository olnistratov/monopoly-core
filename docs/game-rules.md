# HERE`S HOW TO PLAY

### HOW DO I WIN?
Be the only player left in the game after everyone else has gone bankrupt.

**Do this by:** buying properties and charging other players rent for landing on them.
Collect groups of properties to increase the rent, then build houses and hotels to
really boost your income.

### WHO GOES FIRST?
Each player rolls the two dice. The highest roller takes the first turn.

### ON YOUR TURN
1. Roll the two dice.
2. Move your token clockwise round the board the number of spaces shown on the dice.
3. You will need to take action depending on which space you land on. See *Where did You Land?* below.
4. If you move took you **noto or past** the **GO** space, collect M2000 from the Bank.
5. If you rolled a **double**, roll the dice again and take another move (steps 1-4). **Watch out!** If you roll doubles **3 times** on the same turn, you must **Go to Jail**.
6. When you finish your move and action, **pass the dice to the player on your left**.

# WHERE DID YOU LAND?

### 1: AN UNOWNED PROPERTY
There are three types of property:
1. **Sites**
2. **Stations**
3. **Utilities**

You can **buy** the property you land on for the **listed price** on the board space. Pay the Bank,
then take the little Deed card that matches the property and place it near you, face up.
If you **don't** want to pay the listed price, the property goes up for **auction**.
When buying property you should plan to acquire groups.
For example: if you buy a green site, you should try to get the other two green sites during the game.
Owning groups earns you more rent when other players land on them and lets you build on your sites for even 
bigger profits.

### 2: A PROPERTY OWNED BY ANOTHER PLAYER
If you land on another player's property you must **pay rent** to them as shown on the Title
Deed card. You do not pay rent if the property is mortgaged (its Title Deed is face down).
**Important:** the owner must **ask** you for the rent before the player to your left
rolls the dice. If they forget to ask, you don't have to play!

#### Site
The rent for an **unimproved** site is printed on the matching Title Deed card. This is **doubled** if the owner owns all
sites in its colour group and none of them are mortgaged. If the site is **improved**
with houses or hotels, the rent will be much higher - as shown on the Title Deed card.

#### Station
Rent depends on how many stations the other player owns.
* 1 station - M250
* 2 stations - M500
* 3 stations - M1000
* 4 stations - M2000

#### Utility
Roll the dice and multiply the result by **40** - this is the rent you must pay.
If the owning player owns both utilities, multiply the result by **100**.

### 3: CHANCE or COMMUNITY CHEST
Take the top card from the appropriate pile, follow the instructions on it immediately,
then return it face down to the bottom of the pile. If it is a 
_Get Out of Jail Free_ card, keep it until you need to use it or sell it to another player.

### 4: INCOME TAX / SUPER TAX
If you land on one of these spaces, you must pay the Bank the amount shown.

### 5: GO TO JAIL
If you land on this space, you must move your token to the **Jail** space immediately.
**Important:** You do **not** collect M2000 for passing Go if you are sent to Jail,
your turn ends - pass the dice!

#### Other ways to end up in jail...
* Draw a Chance or Community Chest card that tells you to Go to Jail.
* Roll three doubles in a row on your turn.

**Q: How do I get out of Jail?** \
**A:** you've got 3 options...
* **Pay M50** at the start of your next turn, then roll and move as normal.
* **Use a Get Out of Jail Free card** if you have one or buy one from another player. Put the card to the bottom of the appropriate pile, then roll and move.
* **Wait three turns.** On each turn roll the dice; if you get a **double**, move out of Jail and round the board using this roll. If you do not get a double on your third roll, you must pay M50 to the Bank then move the number of spaces rolled.

### 6: JAIL (JUST VISITING)
Don't worry! If you finish your normal move on the Jail space, nothing happens.
Make sure you put your token on the JUST VISITING section.

### 7: FREE PARKING
Relax! Nothing bad (or good) happens.

### 8: A PROPERTY THAT YOU OWN
Nothing happens. But you're not making any money!

# DON'T WAIT FOR THE DICE!
You can do the following even when it isn't your turn-even if you're in Jail!
