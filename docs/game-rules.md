# HERE`S HOW TO PLAY

### HOW DO I WIN?
Be the only player left in the game after everyone else has gone bankrupt.

**Do this by:** buying properties and charging other players rent for landing on them.
Collect groups of properties to increase the rent, then build houses and hotels to
really boost your income.

### WHO GOES FIRST?
Each player rolls the two dice. The highest roller takes the first turn.

### ON YOUR TURN
1. Roll the two dice.
2. Move your token clockwise round the board the number of spaces shown on the dice.
3. You will need to take action depending on which space you land on. See *Where did You Land?* below.
4. If you move took you **noto or past** the **GO** space, collect M2000 from the Bank.
5. If you rolled a **double**, roll the dice again and take another move (steps 1-4). **Watch out!** If you roll doubles **3 times** on the same turn, you must **Go to Jail**.
6. When you finish your move and action, **pass the dice to the player on your left**.
